// IDEA BEHIND THIS PROJECT //

This project is an idea I have had for a while and something that I feel I now have the necessary skills to complete. During my time on campus in college I began to love fast food apps. You order online, you park outside, and you get your food very quick. For a while I have wanted to make something similar and now I feel I can accomplish this in java. 

// HOW I WANT THIS PROGRAM TO WORK //

The program will consits of a gui client class that allows a user to enter food items that they want to purchase. Once they have made their decision and completed their order it will be passed to a server class which recieves these items and logs them. For the purpose of this project I think I will keep the server side very simple by finding a way to log the order in a file and do nothing else with them (Although this is subject to change if I feel like it later in the project). Once the server has succesfully logged the order it will send back a confirmation message to the client. This is the basis of the program I want to write. 

// WHAT IM EXCITED ABOUT FOR THIS PROJECT //

This project will contain multithreading, server sockets, and the swing library. I have a little bit of experience with multi-threading an thus I am excited to learn more. I have a decent understanding of swing however this project will heavily reference from the "Elsa" project I did in CSE 1325. Finally I have been slowly warming up to socket programming for this project however it is the first time that I will be attempting it.
